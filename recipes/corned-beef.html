      melt-in-your-mouth texture. Elevate your lunch with thinly sliced corned beef 
      layered between fresh rye bread.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (3 pound) corned beef briskets with spice packets</li>
      <li>2 (12 fluid ounce) bottles beer (non-alcoholic)</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup peppercorns</li>
      <li>1 bulb garlic cloves, separated and peeled</li>
      <li>2 large bay leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <hr>
    <ol>
      <li>Place briskets into a large pot. Sprinkle one spice packet over top; 
        discard remaining spice packet or save for another use. Pour in beer, 
        then add enough water to cover briskets by 1 inch. Add peppercorns, 
        garlic, and bay leaves, cover, and bring to a boil. </li>
      <li> Reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer, checking hourly and adding more water 
        if necessary to keep briskets covered, until meat is tender and 
        can be easily pulled apart with a fork, at least 4 hours or up to 5. </li>
      <li>Carefully transfer briskets to a cutting board; let rest until they firm up a bit, 
        about 10 minutes. Slice or shred meat, then place onto a platter for serving. 
        Discard cooking liquid or save it for another use. </li>
    </ol>
