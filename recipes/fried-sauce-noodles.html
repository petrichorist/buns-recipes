        <li>Heat a tablespoon oil in your wok over medium heat and add the beef fat 
          (if using). Cook for 1 minute to render the fat down, and add the marinated 
          ground beef to the wok. Cook for a minute to brown it, and then add the 
          ginger, garlic, and mushrooms. Stir fry everything together for another 2-3 minutes.</li>

        <li>While that’s happening, cook the noodles according to the package 
          directions. Mix with the sauce and toss with the julienned carrots, 
          cucumbers, and scallions. This amount of sauce should be good for 4 servings.</li>
